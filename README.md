Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📌 Project Overview

This project applies K-Means Clustering to perform customer segmentation based on Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters to help businesses design better marketing strategies and improve decision-making.

🔑 Objectives

Preprocess and scale customer data

Find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Apply K-Means Clustering for segmentation

Visualize clusters with clear separation of customer groups


🛠 Technologies & Tools

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn


📊 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling the dataset


2. Elbow Method: Determining optimal number of clusters (k=5)


3. K-Means Clustering: Customer segmentation


4. Visualization: Scatter plots for cluster analysis



📷 Visualizations

Elbow Method Graph → Shows the bend at k=5

Cluster Visualization → Groups customers into distinct segments:

Cluster 0: Medium Income & Spending

Cluster 1: High Income & High Spending (Premium)

Cluster 2: Low Income & High Spending (Budget Lovers)

Cluster 3: High Income & Low Spending (Careful)

Cluster 4: Low Income & Low Spending (Low Value)



🚀 Results & Insights

Optimal number of clusters: 5

Businesses can identify target customer groups and design personalized marketing strategies.
